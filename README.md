Simple python script, takes web page with a form that includes some sort of integer authentication code a user must enter, repeatedly guesses at potential values. Inspired by the unknown-to-me individual who brute forced their Telebears code for UC Berkeley class registration. This isn't meant for that though. Just a fun experiment ^_^

Takes about a second to try each permutation.
